# Ultima_Messis
A personal game project in Unity: You are a prisoner optimizing a garden on your cell's balcony. Spend energy to plant and harvest. Discover plant combos based on their Tags ([Root], [Fruit]). Beat the weekly quota dictated by the "Journal" (which also modifies the rules!). Fail, receive your "Report," and buy permanent upgrades.

## 🌾 About the Game
`Ultima Messis` (Latin for "The Last Harvest") is a management and puzzle game with an atmosphere of "cozy dread." You are a prisoner in a dystopian mega-building, and your sole purpose is... to plant.

The world is facing a food crisis. A plague has taken over most of the crops. In response, the government of Plantopia is testing a new strategy to ensure safer production: making plantations happen in locations isolated from the world. A place where the plague cannot enter, whether carried by other plants or by people on their clothes and skin.

Thus, prisoners are chosen to work on these small plantations in exchange for something... but whether this is a good thing is unknown.

This is not a common farming simulator. It is a **turn-based optimization** game. Your only goal is to prove your worth to the system by meeting impossible weekly production quotas, all from within your cell and its small balcony garden.

Failure is bureaucratic, cold, and the only path to progression.

## ⚙️ The Gameplay Loop (The "Turn")
The game is **turn-based management**. Time does not pass. The "Day" (turn) only advances when you decide to sleep.

1.  **Wake Up:** You start the day with **Energy** (e.g., 100).
2.  **Get Briefed:** You collect the **"Journal"** at your door. It dictates the week's **Demands** (prices), **Bonus Missions** (for Special Coins), and the **"Impact Headline"** (a rule-breaking modifier for that week).
3.  **Execute:** You spend Energy on physical actions: planting, watering, harvesting. (Using the PC is free).
4.  **Optimize:** The real puzzle. You arrange your plants in the garden to activate **Tag Combos** and **Specific Combos**.
5.  **Sleep:** You go to bed, Energy recharges, plants advance one growth stage, and the next turn begins.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Deep Garden Puzzle:** Over 20 plants, each with 3 Tags (e.g., `[Root]`, `[Vine]`, `[Likes: Summer]`). Your garden *layout* is the puzzle. Discover Tag Combos (easy) and Specific Combos (secret) to maximize your production.
* **Optimization Roguelite:** You *will* fail. Failing the Quota generates a **"Performance Report"** (your thematic *Game Over*) which gives you **Progress Points** to buy permanent upgrades (new plants, more garden plots).
* **Run Modifiers (Artifacts):** Use **Special Coins** (from Missions) to buy "Artifacts" on the PC. These are *upgrades* that break the rules for that run (e.g., "Inverts adjacency penalties," "Bonus for `[Root]` + `[Fruit]` combo is tripled").
* **"Impact Headline" Events:** The Journal changes the game every week. A "Water Crisis" might double the energy cost of watering; a "Festival" might triple the value of `[Fungus]` plants.
* **Turn-Based Management (Energy):** The day is infinite, but your Energy is not. Every action (planting, harvesting) costs energy, forcing you to decide: "Do I plant everything today or save energy to harvest tomorrow?"
